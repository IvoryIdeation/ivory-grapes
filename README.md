# Ivory Grapes

## What is it?

Ivory Grapes is a React UI builder application that runs on [GrapesJS](https://github.com/artf/grapesjs).

This project started out as a simple experiment to create a timeline animation editor on top of GrapesJS. I was working on a project that required a lot of CSS animations and I got frustrated with having to manually write CSS animations for each change. So I decided to create a UI that would allow me to create and edit css timeline animations visually.

After a successful prototype, I decided to expand the project to include a full UI builder. Currently, the project includes a timeline animation editor and a full set of UI components to quickly build complex UIs.

The following features are included in Ivory Grapes:

* Timeline animation editor
* UI components for quick building of UIs
